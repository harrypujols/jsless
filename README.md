# jsless-pattern-library
A collection of UI patterns done entirely in css

## Development

This site is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), so you will need some dependencies to run it.

```bash
bundle install
```

Once all dependencies are properly installed, run Jekyll.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

 This will render the site at http://127.0.0.1:4000/jsless

 ## Deploy

 ```bash
bundle exec jgd
 ```
